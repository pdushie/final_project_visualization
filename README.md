# DBAS 5115 - Final Project 

##  Exploratory Data Analysis using an Open Data Source

**Due as posted in Brightspace**
 
### Instructions:  
- Open this repository in the browser as shown in class 
- Launch the repository via the GitHub Codespace as shown in class and open it with VS Code
- This is to be an individual assignment (i.e. not group work).
- The **rubric/checklist** on Brightspace **should act as your guide of what to demonstrate in the video**. The video file (or link) should be submitted to **Brightspace** before the deadline.

##  Overview

The objective of this project is to leverage an open data source to conduct exploratory data analysis. Students will utilize Python's Pandas library to manipulate data and create meaningful visualizations using Matplotlib. The project will consist of three Jupyter notebooks, each showcasing **unique datasets** and insightful queries.

**Project Steps:**

1.  **Data Source Selection:**

	You will select an appropriate Open Data Source. Examples include open 			Relational/NoSQL Databases, public APIs, CSV files, JSON data, or XML files. This data source can be in the domain of your choosing, such as finance, healthcare, weather, social media, etc.
    
2.  **Jupyter Notebooks Creation:**

	You should create three separate Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a **unique dataset and exploration**. They should load the data into Pandas DataFrames and perform queries and analyses to extract meaningful insights.
	
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    
    Strive to to answer interesting questions about the data in each Notebook. 
    
4.  **Visualization with Matplotlib:**
    
    You should create visual representations of your findings using Matplotlib. This could include line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, etc., to effectively communicate patterns, trends, or relationships in the data.
    
5.  **Portfolio Showcase:**

	Choose one Notebook as a Portfolio sample to be featured within your Portfolio. This notebook should demonstrate your proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It should showcase your ability to derive meaningful insights from the chosen dataset.

In the video submission, you will be expected to explain your selection of the data source, thought process in your data analysis efforts, perform a code review, and interpret the results within the Notebooks for clarity and understanding. You will also be expected to explain your choice of Portfolio sample.

## Submission Instructions
### Video Recording Submission:

You will demonstrate the completion of this project via a **video screen-capture recording** of you showing and explaining your **completed Jupyter Notebooks** and showing **the Open Data Source** that you selected in order to show completion of the rubric/checklist. You will post **either your video file or a link to it** (e,g, a Microsoft Stream recording, make sure to give the instructor permissions to watch it), to the Brightspace Final Project Dropbox prior to the deadline. If you are not sure of how best to capture such a video, seek advice from the instructor prior to the deadline.

NOTE: YOUR VIDEO MUST VERY CLEARLY SHOW EVERYTHING IN THE RUBRIC/CHECKLIST FOR FULL POINTS SO FOLLOW IT CLOSELY.
